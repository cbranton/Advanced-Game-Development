# The One-sheet
The one-sheet is generally the first document produced to describe a game to potential publishers, developers, or other stakeholders.

The idea is not to go into great detail about the game. The goal is to communicate the game's target audience and why they might wish to play it. You will need to separate your idea from a stack of potential rivals for attention/funding/resources, etc. 

Format varies, but a good starting point is the following:

- Game title
- Intended game systems
- Target age of players
- Intended Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) rating
- Genre and story background (1-2 sentences)
- A summary of the gameâ€™s story, focusing on gameplay (1-2 paragraphs)
- Distinct modes of gameplay
- Unique selling points
- Technical or artistics highlights (if any)
- Competitive products
