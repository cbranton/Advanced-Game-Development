# The Game Design Document (GDD)
## TODO: make a separate GDD and process doc.
The primary audience for the GDD is the development team. For the GDD to be valuable, it must be used. Keep long text passages to a minimum. Use simple charts, diagrams, and external references wherever possible.

The purpose of the GDD is to describe the game in sufficient detail that the team can build it. This does not mean that every decision must be made, only that decisions that have been made are documented clearly and unambigously. Some of the elements you may wish to include:

- Game title
  - optionally followed with a short or working title
- Intended game systems
- Target age of players
- Intended Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) rating
- Genre and premise (1-2 sentences)
- A summary of the game, focusing gameplay (1-2 paragraphs)
- Distinct modes of gameplay
- Backstory and game world
- Gameplay mechanics
- Characters
- Mission and story progression (story beats)
- Features and gameplay highlights
- Technology highlights
- Art and audio highlights
